# Getting started

## Installation

```bash
npm install auth-worker
```

## Usage

First, you'll need to decide [which type of worker you want to use](worker-types.md).

> Note: This example is with Google, but the lib supports [multiple providers](providers.md) out of the box and [custom providers](providers.md) can also be defined.
